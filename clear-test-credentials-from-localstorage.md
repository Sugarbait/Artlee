# Clear Test Credentials from localStorage

## Problem

Your ARTLEE CRM has **test credentials** stored in localStorage that are causing 404 errors from Retell AI:

- API Key: `test_key_175979...` (starts with "test_key")
- Call Agent ID: `test_call_agent_1759791891379` (has timestamp in name)
- SMS Agent ID: `test_sms_agent_1759791891379` (has timestamp in name)

These are **NOT real Retell AI credentials** - they are placeholder values created during testing.

## Solution

You need to clear these test credentials from localStorage so you can enter your **REAL** Retell AI credentials.

---

## Step 1: Open Browser Console

1. Open ARTLEE CRM at `http://localhost:8001` (or your production URL)
2. Press **F12** or **Ctrl+Shift+I** to open Developer Tools
3. Click the **Console** tab

---

## Step 2: Run Cleanup Commands

Copy and paste **ALL** of these commands into the console:

```javascript
// Clear all credential storage locations
localStorage.removeItem('retell_credentials_backup');
localStorage.removeItem('__emergencyRetellCredentials');
localStorage.removeItem('__fallbackRetellConfig');
localStorage.removeItem('__retellCredentialsBackup');
sessionStorage.removeItem('retell_credentials_backup');

// Clear credentials from all user settings keys
Object.keys(localStorage).filter(k => k.startsWith('settings_')).forEach(k => {
  try {
    const settings = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(k) || '{}');
    if (settings.retellApiKey || settings.callAgentId || settings.smsAgentId) {
      delete settings.retellApiKey;
      delete settings.callAgentId;
      delete settings.smsAgentId;
      localStorage.setItem(k, JSON.stringify(settings));
      console.log('‚úÖ Cleared credentials from', k);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error processing', k, error);
  }
});

// Clear window memory
delete window.__retellCredentialsBackup;

console.log('\n‚úÖ All test credentials cleared from localStorage!');
console.log('üìã Next: Refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)');
```

## Step 3: Hard Refresh the Page

After running the commands above:

1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac) to hard refresh
2. This clears the page cache and forces a fresh load

---

## Step 4: Enter Your REAL Retell AI Credentials

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API Configuration**
2. The fields should now be **blank**
3. Enter your **REAL** Retell AI credentials:
   - **API Key**: Should start with `key_` (production) or `sk_` (secret key)
   - **Call Agent ID**: Should start with `agent_` (from your Retell AI dashboard)
   - **SMS Agent ID**: Should start with `agent_` (from your Retell AI dashboard)
4. Click **Save**

---

## Step 5: Verify Credentials Are Saved

1. Refresh the page again
2. Go back to Settings ‚Üí API Configuration
3. Your credentials should still be there (not blank)
4. Check the browser console for logs:

```
üè¢ [TENANT] getCurrentTenantId() called - Returning: "artlee"
‚úÖ Credentials saved for tenant: artlee
```

## How to Find Your REAL Retell AI Credentials

If you don't have your Retell AI credentials:

1. **Log in to Retell AI Dashboard**: https://app.retellai.com
2. **API Key**:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí API Keys
   - Copy your API key (starts with `key_`)
3. **Call Agent ID**:
   - Go to Agents ‚Üí Select your call agent
   - Copy the Agent ID from the URL or agent details
4. **SMS Agent ID**:
   - Go to Agents ‚Üí Select your SMS agent
   - Copy the Agent ID from the URL or agent details

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Credentials disappear after refresh
**Solution**: The credentials weren't saved to Supabase. Make sure you:
- Clicked the "Save" button in API Configuration
- Saw a success message after saving
- Check browser console for any errors

### Problem: Still getting 404 errors
**Solution**:
1. Verify your credentials are correct (copy them again from Retell AI dashboard)
2. Make sure your Agent IDs are for **your Retell AI account**, not example/test IDs
3. Check that your API key has proper permissions in Retell AI

### Problem: Don't see API Configuration section
**Solution**:
- Make sure you're logged in as a Super User
- Check that Settings page has loaded completely
- Try refreshing the page

## After Clearing Test Credentials

Once you've cleared the test credentials and entered your real ones:

- ‚úÖ Dashboard will load real call/SMS data from your Retell AI account
- ‚úÖ No more 404 errors
- ‚úÖ Costs will reflect actual usage from your account
- ‚úÖ All features will work with your real data
