# Stripe Automatic Monthly Invoice Setup Guide

## Overview

The CareXPS Healthcare CRM now includes a fully automatic monthly invoice generation system that:

âœ… Generates invoices on the 1st of each month for previous month's services
âœ… Runs via Supabase Cron (hands-off, even when app is closed)
âœ… Also triggers when user logs in on the 1st (backup mechanism)
âœ… Retries up to 3 times if generation fails
âœ… Sends email notifications on success/failure
âœ… Tracks all invoices in database with audit logging

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure Stripe in UI

1. Log into CareXPS CRM
2. Go to **Settings â†’ Stripe Invoicing**
3. Enter your Stripe Secret API Key (from [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys))
4. Click **"Initialize Stripe"**
5. Enter customer email and name
6. Toggle **"Enable Automatic Invoicing"** to ON

That's it! Invoices will now generate automatically every month.

---

## Setup Details

### Prerequisites

- **Stripe Account**: Sign up at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
- **Stripe API Key**: Get from [Dashboard â†’ API Keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
- **Supabase Project**: For database and cron scheduling
- **Customer Email**: Email where invoices will be sent

### Database Setup

Run the migration to add required tables and columns:

```bash
# Apply migration
supabase db push

# Or manually run:
psql -h your-db-host -U postgres -d postgres -f supabase/migrations/20250101000001_add_stripe_auto_invoice.sql
```

This creates:
- `invoice_history` table - Tracks all generated invoices
- `user_settings` columns - Stores auto-invoice configuration

### Supabase Edge Function Deployment

For truly hands-off operation, deploy the Supabase Edge Function with cron:

```bash
# 1. Install Supabase CLI
npm install -g supabase

# 2. Login
supabase login

# 3. Link your project
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# 4. Set Stripe secret
supabase secrets set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_stripe_key

# 5. Deploy function
supabase functions deploy generate-monthly-invoices

# 6. Set up cron (run in Supabase SQL Editor)
SELECT
  cron.schedule(
    'generate-monthly-invoices',
    '0 2 1 * *', -- 2 AM on 1st of each month
    $$
    SELECT
      net.http_post(
        url:='https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/generate-monthly-invoices',
        headers:='{"Content-Type": "application/json", "Authorization": "Bearer ' || current_setting('app.settings.service_role_key') || '"}'::jsonb,
        body:='{}'::jsonb
      ) as request_id;
    $$
  );
```

See `supabase/functions/generate-monthly-invoices/README.md` for detailed deployment instructions.

## How It Works

### Dual Trigger System

**Primary Trigger: Supabase Cron**
- Runs at 2 AM on 1st of each month
- Works even when app is closed
- Processes all users with auto-invoice enabled

**Backup Trigger: Login Check**
- Runs when user logs in on the 1st
- Ensures invoice generation even if cron fails
- Non-blocking (runs in background)

### Invoice Generation Flow

```
1st of Month
    â†“
Check if auto-invoice enabled
    â†“
Calculate previous month costs
    â†“
Create Stripe invoice
    â†“
Send invoice to customer
    â†“
Save to invoice_history
    â†“
Send email notification
```

### Retry Logic

If invoice generation fails:
1. **Attempt 1**: Initial try
2. **Wait 5 seconds**
3. **Attempt 2**: Retry
4. **Wait 5 seconds**
5. **Attempt 3**: Final retry
6. **If all fail**: Log error and send notification

### Cost Calculation

Invoices include:

**Voice Calls:**
- Retell AI fees (from API)
- Twilio voice costs ($0.022 USD/min)
- Converted to CAD

**SMS Conversations:**
- Twilio SMS segment costs ($0.0083 USD/segment)
- +4 segment overhead for initial prompt
- Converted to CAD

**Total = Call Costs + SMS Costs**

## Testing

### Manual Test (Generate Last Month's Invoice)

1. Go to Settings â†’ Stripe Invoicing
2. Ensure auto-invoice is enabled
3. Click **"Generate Last Month's Invoice"**
4. Check console for logs
5. View invoice in Stripe Dashboard

### Test Cron Function Manually

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/generate-monthly-invoices' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type": "application/json"
```

### Test Login Trigger

1. Set your system date to the 1st of a month
2. Log out and log back in
3. Check browser console for auto-invoice logs
4. Should see: "ðŸ“… Auto-invoice check passed"

---

## Monitoring

### View Function Logs (Supabase)

```bash
# View recent logs
supabase functions logs generate-monthly-invoices --tail

# Or in Supabase Dashboard:
# Edge Functions â†’ generate-monthly-invoices â†’ Logs
```

### Check Cron Job Status (SQL)

```sql
-- View all cron jobs
SELECT * FROM cron.job;

-- View recent cron executions
SELECT * FROM cron.job_run_details
WHERE jobname = 'generate-monthly-invoices'
ORDER BY start_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Audit Logs

All auto-invoice operations are logged to `audit_logs`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM audit_logs
WHERE action LIKE '%INVOICE%'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Invoice Not Generated

**Check 1: Toggle Enabled?**
```sql
SELECT stripe_auto_invoice_enabled FROM user_settings WHERE user_id = 'your-id';
```

**Check 2: Customer Info Set?**
```sql
SELECT stripe_customer_email, stripe_customer_name FROM user_settings WHERE user_id = 'your-id';
```

**Check 3: Already Generated?**
```sql
SELECT * FROM invoice_history
WHERE user_id = 'your-id'
AND invoice_month = '2025-01' -- Current month
ORDER BY generated_at DESC;
```

**Check 4: Cron Running?**
```sql
SELECT * FROM cron.job_run_details
WHERE jobname = 'generate-monthly-invoices'
ORDER BY start_time DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Stripe Errors

**Error: "Stripe not initialized"**
- Solution: Enter API key in Settings â†’ Stripe Invoicing

**Error: "Customer not found"**
- Solution: Service creates customers automatically
- Check Stripe Dashboard â†’ Customers

**Error: "Invalid API key"**
- Solution: Verify key is correct (starts with `sk_`)
- Ensure using secret key, not publishable key

### Email Notifications Not Sent

Email notifications are logged but not yet fully implemented.

To check if notification would have been sent:
```sql
SELECT * FROM audit_logs
WHERE action = 'AUTO_INVOICE_NOTIFICATION_SENT'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if I miss enabling it and the 1st passes?**
A: You can manually generate last month's invoice anytime using the "Generate Last Month's Invoice" button.

**Q: Can I disable it temporarily?**
A: Yes, just toggle it off in Settings. It won't generate invoices until you re-enable it.

**Q: What happens if the cron job fails?**
A: The login trigger acts as a backup. When you log in on the 1st, it will generate the invoice.

**Q: Can I customize the invoice?**
A: Currently no. Invoices include voice calls and SMS conversations with 30-day terms. Customization can be added in the future.

**Q: How do I change the customer email?**
A: Update it in Settings â†’ Stripe Invoicing. New invoices will use the updated email.

**Q: Will it generate invoices for months with $0 costs?**
A: No. If there are no charges for a month, no invoice is generated.

**Q: Can I see past invoices?**
A: Yes, check the `invoice_history` table or Stripe Dashboard â†’ Invoices.
